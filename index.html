        <p>Art is something that i cant stop myself from doing.  once i get a paintbrush or a pencil in my hand. i can know exactly what to paint.  and once i have a vision in my head of that art nothing can stop me from doing what i love.  i am so good at painting that my art work has been presented in art gallaries and different baanquets.  i am very happy while painting and i am very happy to see how far i have came with art.  and i still enjoy doing art in all of my free time whenever i possibly can.  so once again i just wanted to say i am extremly happy with how far i have come with my drems of art.  </p>
